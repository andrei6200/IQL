/*@Doc:
    
    The {\tt r_Storage_Layout} class is used to express the storage options 
    for {\tt r_Marray} objects. This is the superclass of different storage 
    layout classes which may be used for different types of storage layout
    schemes. It is also used directly by the rasdaman client for
    default storage layout, i.e., for the storage layout for objects for 
    which absolutely none has been defined.    
  
  Notice: the tiling options are invalid if the rasdaman client is running 
          with the option notiling. In that case, no tiling is done, 
	  independently of the storage layout chosen.
	  For the time being, compression does not work.
