  Through inheritance of this class, the type definer specifies that
  the subclass is capable of having persistent as well as transient
  instances.
  
  {\bf Attention: }Right now, just the classes \Ref{r_Set} and \Ref{r_Marray} 
  inherit from \Ref{r_Object} which, therefore, are the only persistent 
  capable classes. In fact, just objects of type {\tt r_Set<r_Ref<r_Marray<...>>>}
  can be made persitent right now.
