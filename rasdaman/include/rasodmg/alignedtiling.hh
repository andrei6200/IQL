/*@Doc:
    
    The {\tt r_Aligned_Tiling} class is used to express the options 
    for aligned tiling of {\tt r_Marray} objects. 
    
    The following options may be set:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Tile configuration}
    
         describes which format tiles should have. The tile configuration 
	 is expressed using a multidimensional interval {\tt r_Minterval}.
	 This interval should have null lower limits and 
	 must have the same dimensionality as that of the 
	 objects to which it is to be applied. Its lengths along each 
	 direction are interpreted relative to the others. 
	 
	 For example, if tile configuration is {\tt[ 0:9, 0:9, 0:19]}, tiles 
	 will be three dimensional arrays with two sides of equal length and 
	 double that length along the third direction. 
	 
	 If a fixed tile is required, tile configuration and 
	 tile size should be set in such a way that the size of a tile 
	 with the given configuration is equal to the specified tile size.
	 For example, if the tile configuration is {\tt [ 0:29, 0:39, 0:59]} 
	 and cell size is 2, then the tile size should be set to 
	 144000. This will also result in more efficient computation of 
	 the tiling since the given tile configuration is used unchanged if
	 
	   {\tt 90% * tile_size < size of tile_config  < tile_size}
	 
	 (i.e., no computation is necessary). This applies equally to tile 
	 configurations with non-fixed limits.
	 
	 Tiles with non-fixed limits are used to express preferential 
	 directions for tiling. For example, {\tt [ 0:9 , 0:* ]} expresses that 
	 tiles should be done along the first direction, i.e., they
	 should have domains :
	 
	 \begin{verbatim}
     [  0 :  9 , 0 : marray.domain[1].high() ]
     [ 10 : 19 , 0 : marray.domain[1].high() ]
     ...
	 \end{verbatim}
	 
	 assuming this results in a tile with the given tile size. If not,
	 the limits in the first direction are changed. The higher dimensions 
	 are given preference in that tiles will be preferably
	 extended along a higher dimension than a lower one if two or
	 more limits are open. 
	 
	 The default configuration corresponds to an interval with equal
	 lengths along all directions.
	
    \item {\bf Tile size }  
    
         describes the size for tiles of the object in characters. 
	 Tiling is done so that tiles are as big as possible but wit a 
	 smaller size than this one.
	 The default tile size is the size specified for the RasDaMan client. 
  
  Notice: the tiling options are invalid if the rasdaman client is running 
          with the option notiling. In that case, no tiling is done, 
	  independently of the storage layout chosen.
