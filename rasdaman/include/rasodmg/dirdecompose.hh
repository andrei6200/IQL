/*@Doc:

  The {\tt r_Dir_Decompose} class is used to specify a decomposition on 
  an n-dimensional cube (for use in {\tt r_Dir_Tiling}). For instance, to 
  specify a tiling restriction on a dimension with the form: [0, 2, 4, 5], 
  the following code would apply:

    r_Dir_Decompose decomp;
    
    decomp << 0 << 2 << 4 << 5;

  Note that the first and the last elements input into the object must be 
  the origin and limit of that dimension or else a cross-section of the domain 
  will occur (as if the elements outside the specification wouldn't mind). 

  If one dimension is considered to be a prefered access direction, then
  the r_Dir_Decompose should be empty, this is, no restriction should be
  entered.
