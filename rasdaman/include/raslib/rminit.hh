// Macro for initialization of static members and creation of global RMInit instance
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The macro has to be invoked exactly once in each executable using raslib.
//
// rasserver -> in servercomm.o
// rasdaman clients -> in clientcomm.o
// test programms without clientcomm.o and servercomm.o -> in main.o
//
// The reason is that initialisation of globals can be initialized in any
// order if they are in different files. Only in one file the order is defined.
// As it is implemented now, the streams have to be defined somewhere. This
// could easily be done in rminit.cc. But the call to the constructor of RMInit
// has to get a flag for client ('C') or server ('S') as a parameter. This has
// be done somewhere else. In that case the constructor may be called before
// initialization of the streams, the pogram crashes! If all initialisations
// are in the same file, the order is defined. That is what this macro is for.
//
// Note: At some point it may be useful to reimplement this mess.
